# 1.4b-Age-calculator-program

### Create a program that 
1. Allows the user to enter the year that they were born. (And properly instructs them)
2. Calculates their age (or what how old they will be)
3. How old they will be in 5 years
4. Double their age
5. Half their age (bonus: with a decimal)
7. How many years they have beyond a multiple of ten (i.e. 23 is 3, 17 is 7, 34 is 4)
8. How many years they have until they are a multiple of ten (i.e 23 is 7, 18 is 2, 30 is 0)

### A sample input screen is:
Input your year of birth: \n
(user enters their year of birth)

### Sample Output Screen:
Year entered:                 1993
Age:                          27
Age in 5 years:               32
Double age:                   54
Half age:                     13.5
Years above a mult. of 10:    7
Years until a mult. of 10:    3
